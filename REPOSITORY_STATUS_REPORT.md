## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

### 🔍 **Build Warnings (Non-Critical)**
1. **Unused variables** in several files:
   - `UserContext.tsx`: `setUpcomingTrips` variable
   - `DestinationDetailPage.tsx`: `id` variable
   - `ProfilePage.tsx`: `User` import
   - `TripsPage.tsx`: `Users` import

2. **Deprecated packages** (common in React ecosystem):
   - Various Babel plugins that have been merged to ECMAScript standard
   - Some older dependencies (svgo, rimraf, workbox packages)

### 📝 **Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Clean up unused variables**:
   ```bash
   # Remove or use the flagged variables to eliminate warnings
   ```

2. **Update deprecated dependencies** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - The `.env` file exists but should be configured with proper API keys for production
   - Consider adding environment-specific configurations
